# Contributing
Contributions of all types are welcome, be it code, translations or anything else.

## Important information

When contributing **make sure to submit your contributions to the [GitLab repo](https://gitlab.com/Atrate/libgencheck)**. Other repos (such as on GitHub) are just read-only mirrors from GitLab.

## Code style

Please indent your code with 4 spaces, not the TAB character. Please place opening braces in a new line, like this:
```
function foo()
{
    bar();
}

```

## Translations

If you want to contribute translations, please open an issue first as translation support is not ready yet.
